# Spotify-Playlist-from-Youtube
Takes Youtube's liked music videos and makes a Spotify playlist from it.

Primiarily uses the Youtube Data v3 API and Spotify API
In order to use this script, you need to have a Spotify account and a Youtube account. 

Used https://github.com/TheComeUpCode/SpotifyGeneratePlaylist as a start.
Unlike above, this script does not use the Youtube dl API, and instead webscrapes Youtube's video page source for the information.
